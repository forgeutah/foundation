Forge Utah Foundation ("FUF") Charter

Effective July 10 2019

**1. Mission of the Forge Utah Foundation.**

The Foundation's mission is help grow technology education and talent in Utah by sharing, learning, and building. 

Share - First and foremost we believe in sharing information. Our goal is to facilitate sharing as a form of “enlightened self interest” (sharing freely for karma). We also believe strongly in open source and want to share as much code, configs, and general information as possible.

Learn - The Foundation is a place to learn, mainly from content shared by others, but also we plan to host workshops and facilitate learning of all kinds in the local community.

Build - The culmination of all the sharing and learning is ultimately to build. We want to empower our community to build the next generation of technology.
